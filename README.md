# reactdump
Outputs variables in a visual, easy to read format based on ColdFusion's CFDUMP tag

Based on Andrew Hewitt's [nodedump](https://raw.github.com/ragamufin/nodedump)

Think of it as `console.log` on steroids. Recurses fully into levels deep objects.
Sometimes visualizing a complex object makes it easier to think about.
For example, ```<Reactdump obj={user} />``` might yeild:
