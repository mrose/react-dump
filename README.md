# reactdump
A visual debugging component for React. Outputs any variable in an easy to read format based on ColdFusion's CFDUMP tag.

Inspired by Andrew Hewitt's [nodedump](https://raw.github.com/ragamufin/nodedump)

Think of it as `console.log` on steroids. Recurses fully into levels deep objects.
Sometimes visualizing a complex object makes it easier to think about.
For example, ```<Reactdump obj={user} />``` might yeild:
